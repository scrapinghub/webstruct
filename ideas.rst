Some ideas
==========

* Remove "click here" links;
* handle more punctuation symbols as features, not as tokens - this
  way there will be more token-level chains. Only comma is handled
  this way now;
* introduce more features (they are quite basic now);
* switch to an another CRF implementation (Wapiti is hard to use as a library).
