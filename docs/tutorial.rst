Tutorial
========

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with machine learning.


Get annotated data
------------------

First, you need the training/development data. We suggest to use
WebAnnotator_ Firefox extension to annotate HTML pages.

Recommended WebAnnotator options:

Pro tip - enable WebAnnotator toolbar buttons:

.. image:: images/wa-buttons.png

Follow WebAnnotator `manual <http://perso.limsi.fr/xtannier/en/WebAnnotator/>`__
to define named entities and annotate some web pages (nested WebAnnotator 
entities are not supported). Use "Save as.." menu item or "Save as" 
toolbar button to save the results; don't use "Export as".

After that you can load annotated webpages as lxml trees::

    import webstruct
    trees = webstruct.load_trees("train/*.html", webstruct.WebAnnotatorLoader())

See :ref:`html-loaders` for more info.
GATE_ annotation format is also supported.

From HTML to Tokens
-------------------

To convert HTML trees to a format suitable for sequence prediction algorithm
(like CRF, MEMM or Structured Perceptron) the following approach is used:

1. Text is extracted from HTML and split into tokens.
2. For each token a special :class:`~.HtmlToken` instance is created. It
   contains information not only about the text token itself, but also about
   its position in HTML tree.

A single HTML page corresponds to a single input sequence
(a list of HtmlTokens). For training/testing data
(where webpages are already annotated) there is also a list of labels for
each webpage, a label per HtmlToken.

To transform HTML trees into labels and HTML tokens
use :class:`~.HtmlTokenizer`.

::

    html_tokenizer = webstruct.HtmlTokenizer()
    X, y = html_tokenizer.tokenize(trees)

Input trees should be loaded by one of the WebStruct loaders.
For consistency, for each tree (even if it is loaded from raw unannotated html)
:class:`~.HtmlTokenizer` extracts two arrays: a list of :class:`~.HtmlToken`
instances and a list of tags encoded using IOB2_ encoding
(also known as BIO encoding). So in our example ``X`` is a list of
lists of :class:`~.HtmlToken` instances, and  ``y`` is a list of lists
of strings.

Feature Extraction
------------------

For supervised machine learning algorithms to work we need to extract
`features <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_%28pattern_recognition%29>`_.

In WebStruct feature vectors are Python dicts
``{"feature_name": "feature_value"}``; a dict is computed for
each HTML token. How to convert these dicts into representation required
by a sequence labelling toolkit depends on a toolkit used; we will cover
that later.

To compute feature dicts we'll use :class:`~.HtmlFeatureExtractor`.

First, define your feature functions. A feature function should take
an :class:`~.HtmlToken` instance and return a feature dict;
feature dicts from individual feature functions will be merged
into the final feature dict for a token. Feature functions can ask questions
about token itself, its neighbours (in the same HTML element),
its position in HTML.

.. note::

    WebStruct supports other kind of feature functions that work on multiple
    tokens; we don't cover them in this tutorial.


There are predefined feature functions in :mod:`webstruct.features`,
but for this tutorial let's create some functions ourselves::

    def token_identity(html_token):
        return {'token': html_token.token}

    def token_isupper(html_token):
        return {'isupper': html_token.token.isupper()}

    def parent_tag(html_token):
        return {'parent_tag': html_token.parent.tag}

    def border_at_left(html_token):
        return {'border_at_left': html_token.index == 0}


Next, create :class:`~.HtmlFeatureExtractor`:

.. code-block:: python

    feature_extractor = HtmlFeatureExtractor(
        token_features = [
            token_identity,
            token_isupper,
            parent_tag,
            border_at_left
        ]
    )

and use it to extract feature dicts::

    features = feature_extractor.fit_transform(X)

See :ref:`feature-extraction` for more info about HTML tokenization and
feature extraction.

Using a Sequence Labelling Toolkit
----------------------------------

WebStruct doesn't provide a CRF or Structured Perceptron implementation;
learning and prediction is supposed to be handled by an external
sequence labelling toolkit like CRFSuite_, Wapiti_ or seqlearn_.

Once feature dicts are extracted from HTML you should convert them to
a format required by your sequence labelling tooklit and use this toolkit
to train a model and do the prediction. For example, you may use
DictVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert feature dicts
into seqlearn_ input format.

.. _CRFSuite: http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/
.. _seqlearn: https://github.com/larsmans/seqlearn

We'll use CRFSuite_ in this tutorial.

WebStruct provides some helpers for CRFSuite sequence labelling toolkit.
To use CRFSuite with WebStruct, you need

* sklearn-crfsuite package (which depends on python-crfsuite and sklearn)


Defining a Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic way to define CRF model is the following::

    model = webstruct.create_crfsuite_pipeline(
            token_features=[token_identity, token_isupper, parent_tag, border_at_left],
            verbose=True
        )

First :func:`.create_crfsuite_pipeline` argument is a list of feature functions which will be used for training.
``verbose`` is a boolean parameter enabling verbose output of various training information;
check sklearn-crfsuite `API reference <https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#sklearn_crfsuite.CRF>`__
for available options.


Under the hood :func:`.create_crfsuite_pipeline` creates a
``sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`` with an :class:`~.HtmlFeatureExtractor` instance
followed by :class:`sklearn_crfsuite.CRF` instance. The example above is just a shortcut
for the following::

    model = Pipeline([
        ('fe', HtmlFeatureExtractor(
            token_features = [
                token_identity,
                token_isupper,
                parent_tag,
                border_at_left,
            ]
        )),
        ('crf', sklearn_crfsuite.CRF(
            verbose=True
        )),
    ])



Training
~~~~~~~~

To train a model use its ``fit`` method::

    model.fit(X, y)

``X`` and ``y`` are return values of :meth:`.HtmlTokenizer.tokenize`
(a list of lists of :class:`~.HtmlToken` instances and a list of
lists of string IOB labels).

If you use :class:`sklearn_crfsuite.CRF` directly then train it using
:meth:`.CRF.fit` method. It accepts 2 lists: a list of lists of
feature dicts, and a list of lists of tags::

    model.fit(features, y)

Named Entity Recognition
------------------------

Once you got a trained model you can use it to extract entities
from unseen (unannotated) webpages. First, get some binary HTML data:

>>> import urllib2
>>> html = urllib2.urlopen("http://scrapinghub.com/contact").read()

Then create a :class:`~.NER` instance initialized with a trained model:

>>> ner = webstruct.NER(model)

The ``model`` must provide a ``predict`` method that extracts features
from HTML tokens and predicts labels for these tokens. A pipeline created with
:func:`.create_crfsuite_pipeline` function fits this definition.

Finally, use :meth:`.NER.extract` method to extract entities:

>>> ner.extract(html)
[('Scrapinghub', 'ORG'), ..., ('Iturriaga 3429 ap. 1', 'STREET'), ...]


Generally, the steps are:

1. Load data using :class:`~.HtmlLoader` loader. If a custom HTML cleaner
   was used for loading training data make sure to apply it here as well.
2. Use the same ``html_tokenizer`` as used for training to extract HTML tokens
   from loaded trees. All labels would be "O" when using :class:`~.HtmlLoader`
   loader - ``y`` can be discarded.
3. Use the same ``feature_extractor`` as used for training to extract
   features.
4. Run ``your_crf.predict()`` method (e.g. :meth:`.CRF.predict`)
   on features extracted in (3) to get the prediction - a list of IOB2-encoded
   tags for each input document.
5. Build entities from input tokens based on predicted tags
   (check :meth:`.IobEncoder.group` and :func:`.smart_join`).
6. Split entities into groups (optional). One way to do it is to use
   :mod:`webstruct.grouping`.

:class:`~.NER` helper class combines HTML loading, HTML tokenization,
feature extraction, CRF model, entity building and grouping.

Entity Grouping
---------------

Detecting entities on their own is not always enough; in many cases
what is wanted is to find the relationship between them. For example,
"**street_name/STREET city_name/CITY zipcode_number/ZIPCODE**
form an address", or "**phone/TEL** is a phone of **person/PER**".

The first approximation is to say that all entities from a single webpage
are related. For example, if we have extracted some **organizaion/ORG** and some
**phone/TEL** from a single webpage we may assume that the phone
is a contact phone of the organization.

Sometimes there are several "entity groups" on a webpage. If a page
contains contact phones of several persons or several business locations
it is better to split all entities into groups of related
entities - "person name + his/her phone(s)" or "address".

WebStruct provides an :ref:`unsupervised algorithm <grouping-algorithm>`
for extracting such entity groups. Algorithm prefers to build
large groups without entities of duplicate types; if a split is needed
algorithm tries to split at points where distance between entities is larger.

Use :meth:`.NER.extract_groups` to extract groups of entities:

>>> ner.extract_groups(html)
[[...], ... [('Iturriaga 3429 ap. 1', 'STREET'), ('Montevideo', 'CITY'), ...]]

Sometimes it is better to allow some entity types to appear
multuple times in a group. For example, a person (PER entity) may have
several contact phones and faxes (TEL and FAX entities) - we should penalize
groups with multiple PERs, but multiple TELs and FAXes are fine.
Use ``dont_penalize`` argument if you want to allow some entity types
to appear multiple times in a group::

    ner.extract_groups(html, dont_penalize={'TEL', 'FAX'})

The simple algorithm WebStruct provides is by no means a general solution
to relation detection, but give it a try - maybe it is enough for your task.


Model Development
-----------------

To develop the model you need to choose the learning algorithm,
features, hyperparameters, etc. To do that you need scoring metrics,
cross-validation utilities and tools for debugging what classifier learned.
WebStruct helps in the following way:

1. Pipeline created by :func:`.create_crfsuite_pipeline` is compatible with
   `cross-validation`_ and `grid search`_ utilities from scikit-learn;
   use them to select model parameters and check the quality.

   One limitation of :func:`.create_crfsuite_pipeline` is that ``n_jobs``
   in scikit-learn functions and classes should be 1, but other than that
   WebStruct objects should work fine with scikit-learn. Just keep in mind
   that for WebStruct an "observation" is a document, not an individual token,
   and a "label" is a sequence of labels for a document, not an individual
   IOB tag.


2. There is :mod:`webstruct.metrics` module with a couple of metrics useful
   for sequence classification.


To debug what CRFSuite learned you could use eli5_ library. With eli5 it would be two calls to
:func:`eli5.explain_weights` and :func:`eli5.format_as_html` with :class:`sklearn_crfsuite.CRF` instance as argument.
As a result you will get transitions and feature weights.
