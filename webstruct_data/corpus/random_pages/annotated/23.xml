<div class="ba-column ba-column-one-half ">
<p><img class="alignleft" title="History 1" height="134" src="/wp-content/themes/austim-wp/images/img_history_1.jpg" alt="Austim Image History 1" width="269"/>Our company was commenced in 1985 by <PER>Peter Rowney</PER>, deciding it was time for a new adventure after many years working in the national Timber industry. With encouragement and financial backing from long term colleague and mentor Denis M Cullity, he commenced trading from the current Landsdale site, as <ORG>Austim (Australian Timber Products Pty Ltd.</ORG>)</p>

<p>Peter’s extensive experience in the local industry coupled with his passion for sales and service ensured the company started on a sound footing. The company’s core products of imported softwood and hardwood were established early and remain to this day. Being non-resource backed, the company was forced to create its own point of difference in the WA market, by offering a wide range of imported product coupled with a superior service offer and the ability to “Source the Unusual”.</p>

<p>In 1989 Austim purchased local company Plymar which had been placed under administration and subsequently became one of Perth’s leading suppliers of specialty veneer and plywood. An emphasis was placed on servicing the cabinet/fit out and marine markets, which is still a major target market. In 1990 <PER>Nick Rice</PER> joined the company, bringing an extensive knowledge of Canadian softwood, after working in the busy Sydney wholesale market. The company quickly established itself as WA’s leading importer and wholesaler of West Coast Canadian species in Western Red Cedar, Oregon, Spruce/Pine/Fir (SPF), Hemlock and Pacific Coast Yellow Cedar.</p>

<p>The company continued to grow as the ’90′s approached and the nucleus of today’s management team joined the company in junior roles. Long term relationships with key suppliers were established, many of which continue today. In 1991 Julian Whitaker joined the company as Sales Administrator and the strong link to the cabinet and furniture market was cemented. During the mid ’90′s, some changes to the distribution model were effected, as the company focused solely on wholesale business. This was successful in a number of markets, but the lack of direct customer contact made some market sectors difficult to retain. By the late ’90′s Austim had decided to return to servicing the exotic timber market directly and the market responded with enthusiasm, yielding very positive results. In 1997 the business became wholly owned by the Rowney Family and ownership remains with them today.</p>
</div><div class="ba-column ba-column-one-half ba-column-last">
<p><img class="alignleft" height="140" src="/wp-content/themes/austim-wp/images/img_history_3.jpg" alt="Austim image of History 3" width="200"/>Also at this time, the company established itself as the leading supplier of value added and pre-packaged timber products to the retail hardware sector. Austim was successful in developing a service focused offer, to hardware chains unable to purchase in large volumes, by offering a wide range of timber products such as Radiata Pine, Tasmanian Oak, Western Red Cedar, Yellow Cedar, Kapur Decking and Jarrah, packaged in convenient size, bar-coded bundles. This business sector has continued to grow and today remains an important contributor to the overall business. In 1999 Nick Rice left the company and Julian Whitaker was appointed Sales &amp; Marketing Manager. 2001 saw John Ford join the business and he is today the Sales Manager WA. In 2001 Peter Rowney’s deteriorating health prompted him to pass control of the company to his son Michael Rowney as Managing Director.</p>

<p>The company is very proud to have been recognised by its customers and peers, with the presentation of a number of awards, including; “Best Supplier – Customer Service”, at the 2003 Furnishing Industry Association of Australia, annual awards, the coveted BDO Kendalls Growth Award in 2008, which recognises the fasted growing family business over a three year period, the Excellence in the Supply of Timber Award at the 2008 Furnishing Industry Association of Australia Awards, as well as the prestigious Supplier of The Year 2008 award, at the same ceremony. These awards best sum up the company’s mission.</p><img class="alignright" height="185" src="/wp-content/themes/austim-wp/images/img_history_2.jpg" alt="Austim Image of History 2" width="181"/>

<p>In 2005 <PER>Julian Whitaker</PER> was appointed <FUNC>General Manager</FUNC> and <ORG>Austim</ORG> celebrated its 20th anniversary with a function that was attended by many customers who had been there at the start. This in itself was a testament to the benefits of building long term profitable business relationships. The future for the company will be centred on the company goals of profitable growth, asset development, continual improvement and relationship management.</p>

<p>2010 saw Austim celebrate 25 years in business as well as a business expansion into the architectural market and specialist building products market.</p>

<p>Today, timber is imported from Canada, U.S.A., Europe, Africa and Asia. The company carries more than 30 species in stock with an inventory close to 2000m3. The company remains one of Australia’s leading suppliers of architectural Claddings, Decking, and ancillary mouldings in Western Red Cedar, Jarrah, Teak and other popular timbers. Austim is Australia’s leading importer of Burmese Teak products, servicing the entire country, through a network of distributors.</p>
