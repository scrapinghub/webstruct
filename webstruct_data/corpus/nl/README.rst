Cleaned data was produced by the following command::

    ./clean_html.py --out nl/cleaned nl/source/*.html

This cleaned data is annotated manually using GATE_ and then saved
to xml files inside 'annotated' folder. 'Save preserving format'
command is used for saving: this mean annotations are saved as custom
